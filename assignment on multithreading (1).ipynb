    "# what is multithreading\n",
    "        Multithreading is a threading technique in Python programming to run multiple threads concurrently by rapidly switching between threads with a CPU help (called context switching). \n",
    "        Besides, it allows sharing of its data space with the main threads inside a process that share information and communication with other threads easier than individual processes.\n",
    "        Multithreading aims to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, which increases performance, speed and improves the rendering of the application."
